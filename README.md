**SMART DUSTBIN**

A Cutting-Edge Approach to Waste Management with Smart Dustbins
A smart dustbin is a more technologically sophisticated version of a standard garbage can. It is sometimes called an intelligent waste container or smart trash can. These bins, equipped with sensors, communication capabilities, and frequently AI-powered features, provide a more effective and environmentally friendly method of managing waste. 

 **Attributes and advantages of smart trash cans:**

-> Automatic opening and closing of the lid: Sensors recognize when a person approaches the trash can and open the lid to facilitate easy dumping. 

-> Waste level monitoring: Inbuilt sensors measure the bin's fill level and notify authorities or maintenance staff when emptying is necessary. 

-> Real-time data collection: Cities and organizations can increase efficiency and optimize waste collection routes by using these bins to collect data on waste generation patterns. 

-> Odor control: Certain models have odor-neutralizing technologies to lessen offensive odors. 

-> Benefits for public health: Smart dustbins can help stop the spread of disease and enhance cleanliness by minimizing the need for manual trash handling. 

**Smart dustbin applications:**

-> Residential areas: Smart dustbins can aid with waste management and offer ease of usage at home.

-> Public areas: Smart dustbins can help keep parks, streets, and public buildings cleaner and litter-free. 

-> Commercial spaces: To simplify garbage management and cut expenses, smart dustbins can be used in restaurants, hotels, and office buildings. 

-> Industrial settings: Smart dustbins can be used by factories and manufacturing facilities to monitor waste generation and enhance sustainability.
