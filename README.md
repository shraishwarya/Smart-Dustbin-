A Cutting-Edge Approach to Waste Management with Smart Dustbins
A smart dustbin is a more technologically sophisticated version of a standard garbage can. It is sometimes referred to as an intelligent waste container or smart trash can. These bins, which are equipped with sensors, communication capabilities, and frequently AI-powered features, provide a more effective and environmentally friendly method of managing waste. 

 **Attributes and advantages of smart trash cans:**

-> Automatic opening and closing of the lid: Sensors recognize when a person approaches the trash can and open the lid to facilitate easy dumping. 

-> Waste level monitoring: Inbuilt sensors measure the bin's fill level and notify authorities or maintenance staff when emptying is necessary. 

-> Real-time data collection: Cities and organizations can increase efficiency and optimize waste collection routes by using these bins to collect data on waste generation patterns. 

-> Odor control: To lessen offensive odors, certain models have odor-neutralizing technologies. 

-> Benefits for public health: Smart dustbins can help stop the spread of disease and enhance cleanliness by minimizing the need for manual trash handling.
